production-readiness-checklist

A check point is a stage in the readiness review at which the 
evaluator examines internal and external cues and "decides" whether or
not to move forward in the evaluation process of the microservice software (it).
This check point list contains detailed checklist to run over 
all microservices—manually or in an automated way.

CHECK POINT - A Production-Ready Service Is Stable and Reliable
• It has a standardized development cycle.
• Its code is thoroughly tested through lint, unit, integration, 
and end-to-end testing.
• Its test, packaging, build, and release process is completely automated.
• It has a standardized deployment pipeline, containing staging, canary, 
and production phases.
• Its clients are known (Identified Callers of API).
• Its dependencies are known, and there are backups, alternatives, fallbacks, 
and caching in place in case of failures.
• It has stable and reliable routing and discovery in place.

CHECK POINT - A Production-Ready Service Is Scalable and Performant
• Its qualitative and quantitative growth scales are known.
• It uses hardware resources efficiently.
• Its resource bottlenecks and requirements have been identified.
• Capacity planning is automated and performed on a scheduled basis.
• Its dependencies will scale with it. 
• It will scale with its clients.
• Its traffic patterns are understood.
• Traffic can be re-routed in case of failures.
• It is written in a programming language that allows it to 
be scalable and performant.
• It handles and processes tasks in a performant manner.
• It handles and stores data in a scalable and performant way.

CHECK POINT - A Production-Ready Service Is Fault Tolerant and
Prepared for Any Catastrophe.

• It has no single point of failure.
• All failure scenarios and possible catastrophes have been identified.
• It is tested for resiliency through code testing, load testing, and chaos testing.
• Failure detection and remediation has been automated.
• There are standardized incident and outage procedures in place within the
microservice development team and across the organization.
A Production-Ready Service Is Properly Monitored
• Its key metrics are identified and monitored at the host, infrastructure, and
microservice levels.
• It has appropriate logging that accurately reflects the past states of the microservice.
• Its dashboards are easy to interpret and contain all key metrics.
• Its alerts are actionable and are defined by signal-providing thresholds.
• There is a dedicated on-call rotation responsible for monitoring and 
responding to any incidents and outages.
• There is a clear, well-defined, and standardized on-call procedure in place for
handling incidents and outages.


CHECK POINT - A Production-Ready Service Is Documented and Understood
• It has comprehensive documentation.
• Its documentation is updated regularly.
• Its documentation contains a description of the microservice; 
an architecture diagram; contact and on-call information; 
links to important information; an onboarding and development guide; 
information about the service’s request flow(s), endpoints, and dependencies; 
an on-call runbook; and answers to frequently asked questions.
• It is well understood at the developer, team, and organizational levels.
• It is held to a set of production-readiness standards and 
meets the associated requirements.
• Its architecture is reviewed and audited frequently.
